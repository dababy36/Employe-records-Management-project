Tasks Not Completed
1. Unit Tests

    Status: Partially implemented but not working due to dependency conflicts.

    Reason: Dependency conflicts in the testing framework.

2. Docker for GUI

    Status: Not implemented.

    Reason: Docker is not ideal for GUI applications due to the need for additional software (e.g., X11 forwarding) and configuration challenges.

3. Oracle Database

    Status: Not used.

    Reason: Configuration challenges on the development machine. MySQL was used as an alternative.
